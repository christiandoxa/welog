# Welog

`Welog` is a logging library designed for Go applications, integrating with ElasticSearch and utilizing `logrus` for structured logging. It supports log management for Go applications running on popular web frameworks like Fiber and Gin, providing detailed request and response logging.

## Installation

To install `welog`, add the library to your Go project by running:

```bash
go get github.com/christiandoxa/welog
```

## Configuration

`Welog` uses a configuration struct to set up the ElasticSearch connection parameters. The `Config` struct allows you to define the ElasticSearch URL, username, password, and index name:

```go
type Config struct {
    ElasticIndex    string
    ElasticURL      string
    ElasticUsername string
    ElasticPassword string
}
```

You can set up the configuration when initializing the middleware as shown below.

## Usage

### Middleware Setup in Fiber

To use the `welog` middleware in a Fiber application, set up the middleware with the configuration as follows:

```go
app := fiber.New()

welogConfig := welog.Config{
    ElasticIndex:    "welog",
    ElasticURL:      "http://127.0.0.1:9200",
    ElasticUsername: "elastic",
    ElasticPassword: "changeme",
}

app.Use(welog.NewFiber(fiber.Config{}, welogConfig))
```

### Middleware Setup in Gin

To use the `welog` middleware in a Gin application, set up the middleware with the configuration as follows:

```go
router := gin.Default()

welogConfig := welog.Config{
    ElasticIndex:    "welog",
    ElasticURL:      "http://127.0.0.1:9200",
    ElasticUsername: "elastic",
    ElasticPassword: "changeme",
}

router.Use(welog.NewGin(welogConfig))
```

### Logging Client Requests

#### Logging Client Requests in Fiber

When using a custom Fiber client, you can log client requests with `welog` using the following method:

```go
welog.LogFiberClient(
    c,
    requestURL,
    requestMethod,
    requestContentType,
    requestHeader,
    requestBody,
    responseHeader,
    responseBody,
    responseStatus,
    requestTime,
    responseLatency,
)
```

- `c`: The Fiber context.
- Other parameters: Include details of the request and response, such as URL, method, headers, body, status, and timing.

#### Logging Client Requests in Gin

For custom logging of client requests within Gin, use the `LogGinClient` method:

```go
welog.LogGinClient(
    c,
    requestURL,
    requestMethod,
    requestContentType,
    requestHeader,
    requestBody,
    responseHeader,
    responseBody,
    responseStatus,
    requestTime,
    responseLatency,
)
```

- `c`: The Gin context.
- Other parameters: Include details of the request and response, such as URL, method, headers, body, status, and timing.

### Logging Outside of Handlers

If you need to log errors or other information outside of a Fiber or Gin handler, you can directly use the `logger.Logger()` instance:

```go
logger.Logger().Fatal(err)
```

### Logging Inside Handlers in Fiber

When logging within a Fiber handler, use the logger instance stored in the Fiber context to ensure consistent and contextual logging:

```go
c.Locals("logger").(*logrus.Entry).Error(err)
```

### Logging Inside Handlers in Gin

When logging within a Gin handler, use the logger instance stored in the Gin context to ensure consistent and contextual logging:

```go
c.MustGet("logger").(*logrus.Entry).Error(err)
```

## Sample Output Logging

Below is a sample output log generated by `logFiber` and `LogFiberClient` functions:

      "targetResponseTimestamp": "2024-09-25T12:34:56.989Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

This log provides detailed information about the request and response, including headers, body, latency, status, and additional metadata, which is useful for debugging and monitoring the application.
